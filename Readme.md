# Synchronization

This code simulate synchronization in the swarm system based on the paper
```
Synchronization of Pulse-Coupled Biological Oscillators
Renato E. Mirollo and Steven H. Strogatz
SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 1990 50:6, 1645-1662
```
The code itself is for homework for RBE 595 Swarm Intelligence class at WPI.

## Disclaimer

This code is buggy and slow. It needs optimization. This is the proof of concept.
